Difficult to use time series on technical indicators because they are made from past data. (Will easily overfit)




Updates:
Crave out test_data from train_data itself in rolling tuning
Instead of hard coding 1 day lag between returns and indicator series, it is better to tune this setting as well
Verify time series in indicator calc to avoid lookahead
Fine tune indicator calculation

Sit n go through step by step and confirm no lookahead
